## **What Is Spam Score?**

**Spam score** is a metric used to estimate how likely a website is to be considered spammy or risky by search engines. It analyzes various signals, including low-quality backlinks, irrelevant linking patterns, thin or duplicate content, over-optimized anchor text, suspicious domain factors, and unnatural link velocity.

A high **Spam Score** means your website may be associated with spam practices, be at risk of a penalty, be unsafe for link building, and be harmful to your SEO reputation. A low spam score means your website is safer, more natural, and less risky for SEO.

## **How to Reduce Spam Score**

### **Remove Toxic Backlinks**

Toxic backlinks from low-quality or spam sites negatively affect your reputation. Correct this by disavowing low-quality links with the help of Google Disavow Tool, eliminating paid or automated links, and not using link farms and PBNs (Private Blog Networks).

### **Build Quality Backlinks**

A single link on a site that is in your niche, has real visitors, and includes you in its own editorial copy, is worth dozens of worthless links. Pursue those relied upon links rather than figures.

### **Improve Content Quality**

Search engines reward material that is recent, original, and also useful. Delete repeated pages, reject spun text, and do not post thin articles that software wrote \- publish pages that answer fundamental questions.

### **Fix Over-Optimization Issues**

Keyword stuffing, forced anchor text, and a maze of internal links all count as over-optimization. Use keywords when they fit, write anchor text that reads like plain speech, and link internally only where it helps the reader.

### **Identify What to Fix First**

Our **spam score checker** report highlights exactly where your site is lacking so you can prioritize improvements effectively.

## **What Is DA and PA?**

### **Domain Authority (DA)**

Domain Authority (DA) is a metric that estimates a website's success on search engine result pages. A range from 0 to 100 is used, with a high score indicating a high ranking capacity. The factors that most affect DA are the quality and quantity of backlinks, the domain's age, and the quality of the content.

Increased DA implies superior ranking potential, stronger trust indicators, and greater natural visibility. A website with a DA of 60 is considered much stronger than one with a DA of 20\. DA, however, is only one of many metrics that search engines consider.

### **Page Authority (PA)**

Page Authority (PA) is similar to DA; however, rather than assessing the authority of the entire website, it evaluates the ranking potential of a specific page. PA relies on page-level backlink optimization, in-page links, and content relevance.

DA and PA apply to competitor analysis, decision-making on link-building, and assessing website strength. They help you understand your position relative to the competitors and what you need to do to improve on what you have done.

## **How to Increase DA and PA**

You have to build a robust, credible website to increase Domain Authority (DA) and Page Authority (PA). The following are the ways: 

* Obtain relevant backlinks on other high-authority websites.  
* Create valuable and original content.  
* Optimize internal links.  
* Eliminate toxic backlinks.  
* Respond to load speed and high UX (user experience).  
* Prevent spammy SEO.

Remember, DA and PA increase gradually. There are no shortcuts. Do not purchase backlinks that can raise the spam rating and lead to fines. It is essential to be patient and work hard.
