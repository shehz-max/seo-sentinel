## **FAQs**

**What is the spam score of a website?**  
Spam Score is a metric developed by Moz to assess the likelihood of a website being penalized by search engines due to potentially spammy signals. It is based on a set of indicators Moz identified to be common to low-quality or penalized websites.  
**What is a good score for spam?**  
As a rule of thumb, a spam score of less than 3 is considered low, meaning that your message should be delivered without much difficulty. A score above 6, on the other hand, is considered a high spam score and is likely to affect your deliverability to a significant degree.  
**What does a 1% spam score mean?**   
According to Moz, a spam score of 1 to 30% signals low spam, 31 to 60% indicates medium spam and 61 to 100% denotes high spam.  
**How can I improve my spam score?**   
Here's a detailed guide to help you lower your SpamAssassin score, optimize your email deliverability, and avoid being flagged as spam.
